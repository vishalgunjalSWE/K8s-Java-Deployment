## 🌟 Project Overview: Docker Java Kubernetes Deployment

The **Docker Java Kubernetes Project** is an innovative initiative aimed at harnessing the power of containerization and orchestration to deliver scalable, efficient, and reliable Java applications. This project demonstrates the integration of modern DevOps practices with cloud-native technologies, focusing on seamless deployment and management of applications using Docker and Kubernetes.

### 🔍 Key Objectives:

- **Containerization**: Utilize Docker to create portable and lightweight containers for Java applications, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
  
- **Orchestration**: Leverage Kubernetes for automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, providing high availability and fault tolerance.

- **Infrastructure Management**: Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles using Amazon EKS and eksctl to provision and manage the underlying infrastructure efficiently.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used:

- **Docker**: For containerizing Java applications, enabling quick deployments and easier version management.
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestrating containerized applications, ensuring seamless scaling and management.
- **AWS EKS**: To host Kubernetes clusters, leveraging the power of cloud infrastructure for enhanced scalability and reliability.
- **Maven**: For managing project dependencies and building Java applications.

### 📈 Expected Outcomes:

By the end of this project, participants will gain hands-on experience in deploying Java applications using Docker and Kubernetes, equipping them with essential skills for modern DevOps roles. This project not only emphasizes technical proficiency but also fosters an understanding of best practices in application deployment, infrastructure management, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD).
